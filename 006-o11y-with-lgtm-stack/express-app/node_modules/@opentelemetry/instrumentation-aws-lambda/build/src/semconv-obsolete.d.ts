/**
* The unique ID of the single function that this runtime instance executes.
*
* Note: Depending on the cloud provider, use:

* **AWS Lambda:** The function [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
Take care not to use the &#34;invoked ARN&#34; directly but replace any
[alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html) with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invokable with multiple
different aliases.
* **GCP:** The [URI of the resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/full-resource-names)
* **Azure:** The [Fully Qualified Resource ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id).

On some providers, it may not be possible to determine the full ID at startup,
which is why this field cannot be made required. For example, on AWS the account ID
part of the ARN is not available without calling another AWS API
which may be deemed too slow for a short-running lambda function.
As an alternative, consider setting `faas.id` as a span attribute instead.
